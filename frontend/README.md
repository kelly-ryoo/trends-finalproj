Description of Project: 
Our project will be a digital planner that will be used by people to plan different areas of their life. We will have a homepage that will have a general calendar for the month we are in and then also a general to-do list for items you need to get done but do not have an exact date yet. We will then have another page that has your weekly planner where you can put your daily to-do list for each day of the week and also list your goals for the week. We are also planning to have a habit tracker page that allows the user to track their habits.
